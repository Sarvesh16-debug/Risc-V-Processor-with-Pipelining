# Risc-V-Processor-with-5-Stage-Pipelining
This repository implements a 32-bit RISC-V processor featuring a classic 5-stage pipeline: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). Designed for efficient instruction throughput, the pipeline enables concurrent instruction processing to improve performance while maintaining simplicity.
